// Pages describes the main pages, which can be seen on the navbar.
// Each page contains dynamic content in a static template. The template
// is set by the UI/UX design team, which is then coded into the website.
// Therefore, the only thing content managers need to worry about is not
// the layout, but just the content, which is the most important thing
// in this case.
